# autohotkey-windows-10-apple-mac-keyboard
AutoHotKey script that allows you to use the keyboard in Windows 10 with Apple familiar keyboard shortcuts.

This is a very nice tool to have if you regularly switch between Windows and Mac. Now you can use the same familiar key combinations in both operating systems.

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
2. Download and install the script file and open it as administrator
3. Enjoy using key combos such as Alt + C to instead of Control + C to copy, Alt + Q instead of Alt + F4 to terminate the currently running app, Alt + Space instead of Win + Q to open search using Cortana, Alt + Backspace instead of Delete to delete file(s).
